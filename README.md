# Learning-SwiftUI

Hey, </br>
I'm Denis and am currently learning Swift / SwiftUI.

This is my first project and I've got some minor issues.

Issues:
 - using Combine, but the Items won't automatically update after an Item is added, but the new item shows up after closing and reopening or pressing the reload button.
 - removing the need of AddItem class
 - preview showing example data
 
Missing Features (not sure how to do that)
 - adding relationships
   - Example: Creating a Topic Entity which then has multiple items (To-Many relationship in CoreData)
      - dynamically adding Items to the Topic in AddItemView by pressing a plus sign
 
 This is just a very abstracted version of the app I'm currently working on, the issues are the same tho.
 
 Thanks everyone, </br>
 Denis
